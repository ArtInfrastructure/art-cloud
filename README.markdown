## Installation

If you don't already have pip, go get and install it: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

I also recommend virtualenv, but YMMV: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

This is the pip magic:

pip install django httplib2 markdown south django-piston boto django-pagination pil BeautifulSoup feedparser lxml psycopg2 simplejson tagging vobject
